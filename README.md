## Overview
This boilerplate serves as a kickstart for your Node.js projects. It showcases:
- A simple Express server with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
- A MongoDB connection using Mongoose.
- Custom middleware that logs every HTTP request (yes, even that one weird 3 AM request!).

## Features
- **CRUD Operations:** Out-of-the-box support for GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Connects to your MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- **Request Logging:** Custom middleware logs each HTTP request to a file (`log.txt`).
- **Modular Design:** Clean and organized codebase thatâ€™s easy to extend.
